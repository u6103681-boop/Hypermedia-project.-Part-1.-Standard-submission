Persona: 
This project is the creation of a page constituting a CV . It has been created with the idea of being in the hands of different HR departments from a wide variety of video game development companies.

Information architecture: 
First of all, at the top of the page, we found a section that shows my name, what my occupation is (or at least what I 'm applying for), and a picture of myself (in this case, a sort of default photo).  Next, we find that the rest of the page is divided into two areas . On the left, we found the main one, with key information about me that would be the main aspects the HR department would like to know. In this section , there are four parts. First, we found the "about me" section , a brief description of who I am , what I like to do, and what my interests are. Next , we found the "education" section, which contains the highest level degrees that I possess, with each text in this part being a link . First , the name of the degree is linked to a page that describes it, followed by the institution where I acquired these degrees, linked to the main pages of those centers. Afterwards, we find on the right side of the page some other information but with less weight. First of all, we find my contact information, followed by the languages I know and the level I have in each one, and lastly, a list of some of my hobbies and interests.

Visual design:

This page is mainly composed of sober colors and pastel tones, which give a more serious and formal feeling, perfect for this kind of document (a CV). I've also chosen this to prevent the eyes from feeling heavy after looking at it for a prolonged time, as well as to make it easier to create contrasts, like in the header, where we find the words "Game Developer" in magenta with an underline of the same color, so it stands out and allows the user to instantly see what I am applying for and what my fields of interest are. Two parts of the page, specifically the header and the aside (the right part), have backgrounds in different tones of blue: a darker one for the header and a lighter one for the aside, making the main part of the CV easier to differentiate from the other parts, as it has a light gray background. 
Next, we can clearly see that the titles are significantly larger than the regular text, and in addition, they have an underline, so they stand out from the other text. 
Finally, the content in this main area is spaced throughout the page, so there aren't many blank spaces, making it easier to read and differentiate parts.
